I'm a programmer that lives in the beautiful Porto, Portugal.

I like to dive into distributed systems and functional programming.

I also love giving technical talks. Some of them were recorded and you can watch me fail multiple times.

I consider myself an avid book read and (sometimes) I like to read scientific papers.
Before COVID-19 I used to run the Porto's chapter of Papers We Love (still planning to get back to it).

Currently, I work at Rows, the next generation spreadsheet, as a backend engineer.

Previously, I worked at Talkdesk, a contact center for innovative enterprise, bootstraping
the data platform team and getting my hands dirty with Elixir and Scala. I had a short stay
at Farfetch, an online fashion retail platform that sells products from over 700 boutiques
and brands from around the world. Also worked at Jumia Services, the leading e-commerce
fulfillment and delivery in Africa.

I might have dropped out from a Master's Degree on Software Engineering at Faculdade de
Engenharia da Universidade do Porto.
