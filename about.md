I'm a passionate Software Engineer with interests around automated workflows, microservices, test-driven development, design patterns, and databases. Currently, I work at Jumia Services, the leading e-commerce fulfillment and delivery in Africa. If you can't find me building software, I bet you'll find me playing videogames or surfing waves in Portugal's Northern Coast.

Currently, I'm taking a Masters degree on Software Engineering at FEUP.
