I'm a passionate Software Engineer with interests around automated workflows, microservices, test-driven development, design patterns, and databases.

Currently, I work at Farfetch, an online fashion retail platform that sells
products from over 700 boutiques and brands from around the world.

Previously, I worked at Jumia Services, the leading e-commerce fulfillment and
delivery in Africa.

If you can't find me building software, I bet you'll find me playing videogames 
or surfing waves in Portugal's Northern Coast.

Currently, I'm taking a Master's Degree on Software Engineering at Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto.
